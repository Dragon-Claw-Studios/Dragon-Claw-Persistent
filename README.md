A general-purpose modpack designed with server longevity in mind, while still enabling access to interesting modded content. Created and maintained for the Dragon Claw Community official server, but made available for self-hosting with no compromise.

The main goal is to keep future Minecraft version compatibility in mind, to allow for easier server migration, and **avoiding total world save loss**. To do so, the focus is to maintain stability of the Overworld, to act as a "safe-haven" for your builds, items and general progress. Any added dimensions or biomes are treated as "experiences" you can go and explore, but it is up to your own discretion if you want to build there, or use the modded blocks and items in the Overworld.

Mods are carefully selected based on various criteria. Mods that add content would be the most troublesome if they stop receiving future updates, so here is a non-exhaustive list of the most common considerations:

‚úÖ - The mod author/team is active.\
‚úÖ - There are no problematic mod compatibility issues known.\
‚úÖ - Minimal impact of sudden mod removal.\
‚úÖ - Added worldgen features primarily use vanilla blocks.\
‚úÖ - No biomes added to Overworld.\
‚úÖ - The features add value to the experience.\
‚úÖ - The mod compliments the vanilla experience/progression, rather than replaces.\
‚úÖ - There is a community demand for the mods inclusion.
